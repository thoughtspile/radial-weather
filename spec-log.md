- plot data radially, with period for angle
- aggregate daily data to combat the daily cycles. can use:
    - min / max -- generally, any quantile
    - day / night / all-day average -- generally, over [T_0, T_1]
- apply moving average
- reduce detail (every n-th)
- graph with no context looks like a circle
    - add origin
    - add reference circle at 0
    - add several reference circles
    - color by categories
- untangle different years with spiral map
    - done in spiral-values, looks terrible
    - try color grouping
- bin weather on a given day of year -- generally, over [D_0, D_1]
    - normalize number of observations when little data
    - use quantiles when data abundant
    - opacity as distance from mean / median, stops at observations (steep gradient)
    - mean line + confidence band
    - mean line only
- once we have categorized and binned the data, we can abstract over the values
    - stacked histogram: percentage of observations by category in a bin
    - spiral map
    - interpolate color
    - bin color = most frequent category (less detail)
- cluster days into meaningful seasons
    - user-defined number of seasons
    - a brief characteristic for each one
    - clear or fuzzy border between seasons
- cloudiness, humidity and rain amount can be plotted similarly in bands
- maybe batch atmospheric conditions
- tackling 2D wind would be tricky, but may attempt
